- 👀 I'm interested in Human-Robot Interaction, Assistive Technologies, and Autism Advocacy.
- 🌱 I'm on a mission to master computer science, armed with my diverse background, passion and borderline stubborn spirit.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that leverage robotics and technology to improve the lives of autistic individuals and marginalized communities.

- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not tackling my PhD research, you can find me strumming away my inner rock star on the guitar or gaming like a true champion (at least in my own mind). It's been a lifelong love affair, though my skills may not always match the hype. I make up for it with pure enthusiasm and the endless patience of my loyal dog Pixel, who seems to enjoy my, shall we say, unique style.
